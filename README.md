# transactionmanagement
The goal of this project is to create a simple transaction management system using Oracle PL/SQL. The system will allow users to create, read, update, and delete transactions. Transactions will be stored in a database table. The system will also provide a user interface for users to interact with the system.

The system will be implemented using the following steps:

1.Create a database table to store transactions.
2.Create a PL/SQL package to encapsulate the logic for managing transactions.

The database table will have the following columns:

1.transaction_id: A unique identifier for each transaction.
2.transaction_type: The type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
3.account_number: The account number associated with the transaction.
4.amount: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
5.transaction_date: The date and time the transaction was created.


The following are some challenges that could be encountered when implementing the system:

1.The database table may need to be designed to support the specific requirements of the system.
2.The PL/SQL package may need to be modified to handle different types of transactions.
3.The user interface may need to be modified to support different features of the system.

Overall, this project will provide a good opportunity to learn about transaction management and Oracle PL/SQL
